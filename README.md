# Set language

A very simple example of antlr4 language application that can parse files containing sets. Example input files can be seen in _./input_ folder.

Except from parsing and printing the set files it can also extract formatting of the input files and then use this to format other files. It was used as a first learning step when creating [Ingrid Extensions](https://github.com/d-kozak/ingrid), where this format extraction process is generified, so any antlr4 grammar could be used.
